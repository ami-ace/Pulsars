# Pulsars
Search for optical counterparts to millisecond pulsars

## Intro
The project aims to search for the optical counterparts to seven Millisecond pulsars as suggested by the astronomical survey
Gaia EDR3. Further, I aim to find binary companions of certain pulsars by creating cross-matches between the DECam PLane Survey
and the CSIRO ATNF Catalogue.
